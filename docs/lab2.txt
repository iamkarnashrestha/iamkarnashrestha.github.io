I did the following things for the lab 2 first task;

placed all the elements as instructed in the question.
-alligned the name to center for better look.
each part such as description,classes, favourite movie, moods, 
fun fact about neighbour, are handled in different section.
-changed the font color of content of description, and funfact using "class element" selector as:
	.description p, .fun-facts li{
    		color: chocolate;
	}
-set the size of both image to 300*300px
-changed the background color of page
-changed the color of hyperlink and changed the text decoration  
-used italic element in the list of funfacts.
-changed font-size,color,font-family using both shorthand and writting whole three line code for those purpose.
(shorthand is commented in the code)
