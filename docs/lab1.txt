Hi professor, I have created basic homepage that meets the requirement of the lab1. Where I used 
different html tags such as header, section, nav, list, etc. I have also used favicon too. The link for  validator for html5 is also placed with the anchor tag in the image at the bottom of page inside footer. 
The page has no errors while validating aswell.

I have hosted the website to the github server as well. I have also implemented some css to place the image to
good position and i have change the style type of unorderlist list item to none for the navigation links.

It was pretty good experience to practice the coding.

The url to the website is: https://iamkarnashrestha.github.io/
The url to the github repo is: https://github.com/iamkarnashrestha/iamkarnashrestha.github.io
